"""
We don't use global variables.

But. Imagine if we could. A file (module) could represent a single Die.

We could import the module and use it like it was an object.
 
It stores the state of the die as global variables.

It provides functions that let us use the die and modify the state.

This is a primitive object. With OOP, we move the object from the module to the heap!
